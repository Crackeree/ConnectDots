It's a two player game. Connect two adjacent dots (horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal), by pressing + holding the mouse buttons and moving the cursor from one dot to another dot.
Keep doing this alternately. If a player gets a chance to make a square, the player will collect a point and be able to play another move. The game ends when every square is occupied by the players.
When the game ends, the player achieving more points wins.
